# Dog Breed Image Convolution

### Tools/Libraries Used: Google Colab, Tensorflow, MatplotLib, Pandas, NumPy

A combination of these tools and a Kaggle provided dataset allowed me to create a predictive model that helps predict whether the breed of a dog from just the image. (Further details are outlined within the notebook)

**The data for this project has been removed (a link to it can be found within the notebook) due to it's massive size. Also note google colab is used because of the need for a GPU in order to train the model.*
